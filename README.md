📥 YouTube Video Downloader (Python)

- A streamlined automation tool that bridges the gap for users who want high-quality offline viewing without a YouTube Premium subscription. Unlike official "app-only" downloads, this project saves standard .mp4 files directly to your local machine for true file ownership.


✨ Features

- Metadata Confirmation: Instantly displays video titles and view counts to ensure the correct content is being fetched.

- High-Resolution Logic: Automatically identifies and targets the highest available video stream resolution.

- Native GUI Integration: Uses tkinter to launch a Windows directory picker for dynamic folder selection.

- Robust Error Handling: Built with a try-except architecture to manage invalid URLs or network interruptions gracefully.

🚀 Demo Procedure

- Launch: Run the script in your Python environment.

- Input URL: Paste the YouTube shareable link into the terminal prompt.

- Verify: Confirm the metadata (Title/Views) displayed in the console.

- Select Folder: Use the pop-up window to choose your destination.

- Download: Wait for the "Download complete!" confirmation.

- Verify File: Open your file explorer to play your new .mp4 file.
